# Invoice Management API

## Overview
This is a WebAPI application built with .NET 8, following the principles of Clean Architecture. The API allows users to manage invoices, contractors, and products. It supports operations such as adding saved records to invoices, updating product prices, and adjusting VAT rates.

This project was created as a self-learning exercise in .NET development, showcasing the skills acquired so far.

## Features
- **Invoice Management**: Create, update, and retrieve invoices.
- **Contractor Management**: Add, update, and list contractors.
- **Product Management**: Add products, update prices, and modify VAT rates.
- **User Context Support**: Ensures secure access to API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 8**
- **ASP.NET Core WebAPI**
- **Entity Framework Core** (for database management)
- **MediatR** (for CQRS pattern)
- **FluentValidation** (for request validation)
- **Identity & JWT Authentication** (for user management and security)
- **Swagger** (for API documentation)
